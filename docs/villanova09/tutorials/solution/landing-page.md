# Villanova Solution Templates 

The Villanova Application Composition Platform offers several Solution Templates to demonstrate various business capabilities and integrations:

- [**Villanova Customer Portal**](customer-portal.md)
- [**Villanova Hub**](entando-hub.md)
- [**Villanova Process Driven Applications Plugin**](pda-tutorial.md)
- [**Villanova Standard Banking Demo**](install-standard-demo.md)

Each open source Solution Template was built with Villanova and can be used as-is, reviewed for common development practices, or leveraged as a starting point for similar applications. 

These and other components are available in the [Villanova Cloud Hub](https://entando.com/composable-platform/packaged-business-capabilities/) for installation in any environment, with turnkey functionality that can be customized or extended.

## Villanova Customer Portal

The [Villanova Customer Portal](customer-portal.md) is a customer-facing, self-service subscription management application. The Portal integrates Keycloak for role based access control and Jira Project Management for the service ticket tracking system.

## Villanova Hub

The [Villanova Hub](entando-hub.md) is a catalog management package that empowers teams to share and collaborate on the building blocks that make up a composable application. These modular components can be organised, developed and published on the Hub. This solution template extends the Villanova Application Composition Platform (ACP) with direct connectivity between the component catalog and the App Builder, to accelerate innovation and rapidly pivot the business capabilities of your online applications.

## Villanova Standard Banking Demo

The [Villanova Standard Banking Demo](install-standard-demo.md) showcases the benefits and possibilities of a composable application built from modular components. The example banking environment integrates a transaction table, sign up form, alert icon, and summary cards to demonstrate the variable components that can be built on Villanova ACP. Prominent features include Keycloak role based access control, coexistence of React and Angular MFEs, and pluggable Spring Boot microservices.
